    This function is intended to determine if f is constant or balanced for a given function f s.t.

        qubit. The algorithm then constructs a Uf oracle gate based on the function input f. It then applies Uf to all
        the qubits and applies H to the first n qubits. Finally, the simulator is run on the circuit and measures the
        results. If upon measurement, the first n qubits are all 0, 1 is returned and the function is constant,
